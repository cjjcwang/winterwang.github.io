![Me](https://github.com/winterwang/winterwang.github.io/assets/bg.jpg)

I am now working as an assitant professor at [Aichi Medical University](http://www.aichi-med-u.ac.jp/). You can find the [home page](https://sites.google.com/site/aichimeduniv/home) of the department I belong to now. I got my PhD from the Department of Public Health, Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya University at 2016. So currently I live in central Japan. I am a big fan of [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and the open-source integrated development environment (IDE) [R studio](https://www.rstudio.com/) as well as many other open-source softwares. But I am only a fan, not an expert. 

我目前在[日本愛知医科大学医学部公衆衛生学教室](https://sites.google.com/site/aichimeduniv/home)做助教。如果你不能打开左边的主页链接，说明你生活在GFW沦陷区内，请学会(肉身)翻墙访问我们研究室的主页。


Thanks for reading!
